### ðŸ‘‰ What is if() in CSS?

The new if() function allows you to apply styles conditionally, just like in programming languages. Depending on the media query or condition, an element automatically gets the appropriate propertyâ€”no more deeply nested media queries!

As a frontend developer, this is a real relief: clearer code, less redundancy, and more maintainable, smarter responsive designs.

**Practical example:**
```css
button {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  width: if(media(any-pointer: fine): 30px; else: 44px);
}
```


Here, the button width is set dynamically based on the input device:
- **30px** for mouse & precise pointer
- **44px** for touch â€“ perfect for accessibility & UX!
