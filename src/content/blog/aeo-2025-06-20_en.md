We have been optimising for Google for years: keywords, metadata, Core Web Vitals.
But what happens when no one searches anymore – but simply asks?

👉 Welcome to the age of **answer engines**:
ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity & Co.
These systems don't provide lists of links, but direct answers.
Relevance is not determined by click rates, but by comprehensibility for AI systems.

## 🔍 SEO = Search Engine Optimisation
## 🧠 AEO = Answer Engine Optimisation

**The difference?**
SEO optimises for algorithms with indexing and ranking.
  
AEO optimises for LLMs that understand – and reproduce – language, logic and context.

---

## What AEO means today:
- ✅ Question-and-answer style content – ideal for prompt patterns
- ✅ Semantic depth – not just keywords, but conceptual relationships
- ✅ Structured content – clear sections, lists, formatting (Markdown, HTML5)
- ✅ Public visibility – GitHub, LinkedIn, blogs, documentation, wikis
- ✅ Technical authority – expertise confirmed by many sources
- ✅ Machine-readable + human-friendly – content for people AND models

---

## A real-world example:
If you publish well-documented GitHub repos, clean docs or didactically strong how-tos,
you'll end up in the answers of LLMs more often – without ever ranking on Google.
This is because LLMs draw on:
- publicly available content (Common Crawl, GitHub, arXiv, StackOverflow)
- embeddings-based similarity patterns
- and what has been identified as helpful and trustworthy during training

---

## Conclusion
Anyone creating content today must ask themselves a new question:
> Would an AI classify my answer as helpful – and pass it on?

If so, you're in the game.
If not, you'll be standing in the shadow of other people's prompt output.
📌 AEO is not an alternative to SEO – it's the logical next step.

I call it:
**Content that thinks. And is understood.**
