## Automated adjustment of image formats
As part of a recent video production, I used Luma's AI-powered Reframe tool â€“ with excellent results. This tool enables automated adjustment of image formats (e.g. from 16:9 to 9:16 or square) without losing key image content or important compositions. 

Reframe was a real game changer for this production, which had to serve different output channels (social media, web, display) with different format requirements. It allowed us to significantly reduce the time-consuming manual editing process while ensuring high visual quality.

## Recognition of relevant image areas
Particularly noteworthy is the AI's intelligent recognition of relevant image areas, which automatically optimises framing and thus noticeably simplifies the creative workflow.

For anyone working in video content who regularly has to meet different format requirements, Reframe by Luma is a highly recommended tool that combines efficiency and quality.

ðŸ‘‰ Attend one of my AI courses, where I demonstrate in a practical way how such tools can be used optimally in marketing, social media and content creation.
